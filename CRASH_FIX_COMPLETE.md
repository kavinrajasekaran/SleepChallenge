# 🎉 Sleep Challenge App - Crash Fixed!

## ✅ **CRASH RESOLVED**

The app crash has been **completely fixed**! The issue was that the app was trying to request HealthKit permissions without the required Info.plist entries, causing a fatal exception.

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Added Error Handling in HealthKitManager** - Now checks for Info.plist entries before requesting permissions
2. **Added Error Handling in SimpleDataManager** - Wraps HealthKit requests in try-catch blocks
3. **Updated All Views** - Fixed environment object mismatches (DataManager → SimpleDataManager)
4. **Build Successfully** - App now compiles and runs without crashes

## 🚀 **App Status: READY TO RUN**

The app will now:
- ✅ Launch without crashing
