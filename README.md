### Tips for Best Results

1. **Consistent Tracking**
   - Wear your Apple Watch to bed
   - Enable sleep tracking in the Health app
   - Sync data regularly

2. **Challenge Strategy**
   - Start with shorter challenges (3-7 days)
   - Focus on one aspect of sleep at a time
   - Use challenges to build healthy habits

3. **Data Accuracy**
   - Ensure your Apple Watch is properly fitted
